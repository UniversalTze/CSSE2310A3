Deleteted process_pipes_stdin and process_pipes_stdout to reduce the duplication of code to keep me below the 50 line limit. Also malloc an integer array to make it easier to close pipes instead of using pointers. Modified pipe_fds so that it does not take any parameters now. It will return a malloc array of file descriptors. Deleted the function close_dangling_pipes, Added a function called process_standard_input that the first 2 children will call. Function will read the file and close appropriate pipe r/w ends. And it will also dup the appropriate ends. Created a function called uqcmp_stdout function that will close appropriate r/w pipes. Will also dup2() the correct pipes needed to exec uqcmp. Also deleted the deletd functions from process.h. Also Added the new functions to process.h and modified the parameters of existing functions.

In process.c, Process args was modified to take one more parameter which is a boolean value of optional quiet command. That argument was passed along, with the current jobnumnber and the number of tests passed. process_uqcmp was modified by adding the quiet boolean ptr to it. It will now handle the cases when --quiet is mentioned on the command line. The kill_reap_process parameters were also modified. Function takes in the job number pointer and does what it needs to do accordingly. Removed two if statements from tetsuqwordiply.c main function and will now print out the number of test passed when running in sequential order. Modified process_args, process_forks and kill_reap_process to return integers, which represents the current passed tests.

In process.h, changes made was that I declared a struct to hold onto the value of all process pids and exit statuses when running a single job. Took kill_reap_process() out of process_forks() and changed return value of process_forks to return a struct. Also moved sleep to process args after forks have been processed. Kill_reap_process is also in process_args which will be run after sleep.

Added a handle sleep() function in process.c and an identifier for that function in process.h. Function will sleep for the remaining time if a sigint was sent from the user to interrupt the test. Up to styling this assignment now.

Fixed a bug in report_test_job(). Makes sure to increment count when both programs exit with the same exit status, and not just the correct exit status (0). If count is 3 (all standard output/ standard error and exit status matches), passed can be incremented before its returned to start the next test.

Renamed the ExitStatus, PipeEnds and Processes enum types in process.h to match styling standards in the spec. Those changes made in process.h also reflect the changes made in process.c when referring to enums in process.h. Also removed the use of magic numbers in pipe_fds() when adding pipe ends to int array by referncing the enums.
